slide1;"What is all this claiming about? Why don't the countries just take what they want? Well, UNCLOS attempt to keep the annexation of oceans civil and within a certain framework, to avoid conflicts. If you need a brief introduction into the framework of UNCLOS before you start exploring on your own, read on. If you think you've got it you can always click the ""skip"" button below. Have fun!"
slide2;The first 12 nautical miles (about 22.2 km or 13.8 miles) from the shore line are considered territorial waters, this is where states have complete control of everything (…) The zone can be extendend to 24 NM by including the 'contiguous' zone (…)
slide3;Extending 200 NM from the shoreline, is the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), this is the zone where a state have right to resources on, under and above the seafloor(…)
slide4;Sometimes, the continental shelf extends beyond the EEZ, this is where it gets tricky. A country can, within ten years of ratifying the UNCLOS, claim the continental shelf connected to said country and the UN, specifically the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) decide if the claim is valid. What happens, then, when more than one country claim the same area, as is the case in the arctic? We'll see.
slide5;"For centuries land has been struggeled over and divided between nations, and still is.
For oceans, this struggle for territory only recently extended beyond the reach of a cannon.

Since the start of the 20'th century, vast areas of the oceans have been annexed by nations to secure the rights to exploit and preserve ressources.
Usually these annexations was agreed upon in bilateral agreements between neighbouring states.

But, with claims starting to include the entirety of the continental shelf, overlapping claims by multiple countries started to appear.

The Arctic ocean is one such area of overlap.

Defined by its location within the Arctic circle at (66° 33'N), the Arctic ocean is surrounded by five nations with major territorial interests;

Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - the Arctic Five.

Under the legal framework provided by the UN's Convention of the Law of the Sea, the struggle to prove ownership of the arctic seabed is well under way.
