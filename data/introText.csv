slide2;The first 12 nautical miles (about 22.2 km or 13.8 miles) from the shore line are considered territorial waters, this is where states have complete control of everything (…) The zone can be extendend to 24 NM by including the 'contiguous' zone (…)
slide3;Extending 200 NM from the shoreline, is the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), this is the zone where a state have right to resources on, under and above the seafloor(…)
slide4;Sometimes, the continental shelf extends beyond the EEZ, this is where it gets tricky. A country can, within ten years of ratifying the UNCLOS, claim the continental shelf connected to said country and the UN, specifically the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) decide if the claim is valid. What happens, then, when more than one country claim the same area, as is the case in the arctic? We'll see.
