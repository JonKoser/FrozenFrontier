slide1;"Now, in 2014, most land above sealevel has been claimed and much of the attention has turned towards the ocean floor. Instead of a scramble for the continental shelf, the framework provided by the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS ) expect scientific data to back a claim. This data is reviewed by The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) who then provide a recommendation for establishing a new border. If you need a brief introduction into this framework before you start exploring on your own, read on. If you think you've got it you can always click the ""skip"" button below. Have fun!"
slide2;"The first 12 nautical miles (about 22.2 km or 13.8 miles) from the shore line are considered territorial waters, this is where states have complete control, but innocent passage is allowed. This zone can be extended to 24 NM by including the 'contiguous' zone. In this zone a state has the right to: (a) prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea;

(b) punish infringement of the above laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea."
slide3;Extending 200 NM from the shoreline, is the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), this is the zone where a state have sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the production of energy from the water, currents and winds.
slide4;Sometimes, the continental shelf extends beyond the EEZ. The coastal state can, within ten years of ratifying the UNCLOS,  establish the outer edge of the continental margin wherever the margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles (The EEZ). The CLCS then review the evidence provided for establishing this new limit. Now, close this introduction to start your exploration of claims in the Frozen Frontier.
slide5;"For centuries land has been struggled over and divided between nations, and still is.
For oceans, this struggle for territory only recently extended beyond the reach of a cannon.

Since the start of the 20'th century, vast areas of the oceans have been annexed by nations to secure the rights to exploit and preserve ressources.
Usually these annexations was agreed upon in bilateral agreements between neighbouring states.

But issues arose because of overlapping claims and when the Continental Shelf .

The Arctic ocean is one such area of overlap.

Defined by its location within the Arctic circle at 66 degrees north, the Arctic ocean is surrounded by five nations with major territorial interests there;

Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - the Arctic Five.

Under the legal framework provided by the UN's Convention of the Law of the Sea, the struggle to prove ownership of the arctic seabed is well under way.
